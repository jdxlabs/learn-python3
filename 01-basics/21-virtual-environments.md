Virtual envionments allow you to have distinct versions of packages for your different projects.

There are different ways to create virtual environments:

- Using [Venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (or pyenv), the built-in module for creating virtual environments in Python 3.
- Using [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable), a third-party tool that provides similar functionality as venv but works with both Python 2 and Python 3.
- Using [Conda](https://conda.io/docs), a package and environment management system often used in data science and scientific computing.
- Using [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/stable), a higher-level tool that combines package management and virtual environment management, using Pipfile.

You will find some examples in the next section "02-pip-module", for Venv and Pipenv.
