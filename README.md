> Like a kung fu master, a Pythonista knows how to kill with a single finger, and never to actually do it.

Python is a very concise and efficient language,  
it allows you to work in different domains :  
scripting, web development, datasciences, gui interfaces, etc.  
and to write portable code for every platforms.  

It's a good starting point to learn programming in general  
because it is a multi-paradigm language,  
it will let you explore a lot of different patterns.

you have to adopt a rigor to write great code,  
we consider we are all responsible users.  

Have fun with this language,  
may this lessons help you in the path to masterize Python  
and to make amazing things with it.
